        Delicious Japanese chicken curry recipe for a weeknight dinner! 
        Tender pieces of chicken, carrots, and potatoes cooked in a rich 
        savory curry sauce, this Japanese version of curry is a must-have 
        for your family meal. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The bite-sized chunks of meat, the thick-cut vegetables, the rich 
        and creamy brown curry sauce, and the fluffy rice are what makes 
        every bite so comforting and exciting to eat. Not only is it a meal 
        that is easy to make on busy nights, but it also tastes better the 
        second day.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp kosher salt</li>
            <li>freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>Japanese curry roux</li>
            <li>3 Yukon gold potatoes</li>
            <li>2 onions</li>
            <li>2 carrots</li>
            <li>1 knob ginger</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>1/2 apple</li>
            <li>4 cups chicken stock</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut the onions into wedges. I like to have the texture of the onions in my curry, so I cut them into thick wedges. If you prefer, you can mince or thinly slice the onions so they disintegrate into the sauce.</li>
            <li>Peel the carrots and cut them into rolling wedges (it's called rangiri in Japanese). This type of cut creates more surface area, which helps the carrots absorb more flavor and cook faster.</li>
            <li>Peel the potatoes. Cut each potato into quarters (6 pieces for russet potatoes). Soak them in water for 15 minutes to remove excess starch.</li>
            <li>Grate the ginger, mince the garlic, and set aside.</li>
            <li>Cut the apple into quarters, remove the core, and peel the skin</li>
        </ol>
